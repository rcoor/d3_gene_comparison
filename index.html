                <p class="serif" style="margin-top: 10px;">We are all unqiue in some way. Facial features, emotions, way of thinking, etc. are all features that seperately
                    or together define us as being unique. These differences often seem significant enough for us to be able
                    to classify and recognize other people. In truth, many of the things that makes us unique are woven into
                    our DNA as single mutations that often makes the whole difference.</p>

                <h3 class="serif">Scoring algorithm</h3>
                <p class="serif">
                    The scoring for each category is based on a weight-scoring algorithm. Litterature on genotypes that are linked to specific
                    categories are reviewed and scores for different genotype variants are applied. Some categories are build
                    from multiple genotypes and some are binary, meaning that the genotype works as a on/off switch for a
                    specific phenotype. The sum of contribution for each genotype is used as a max score for the given category.
                    When a test is being done on a person the genotypes are linked to the scores and a score is applied.
                    This is then compared with the max score and thus a percentage score can be calculated. The outcome of
                    a category is then set as bounds in percentage, e.g. score
                    <=2 5 gives low, score <=5 0 gives medium low, score <=7 5 medium high, etc. Each category is also applied a confidence score
                        (not shown here). </p>

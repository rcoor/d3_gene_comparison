            "body":"You are genetically likely to have a normal appetite.\r\n\r\nThis means that your body is good at regulating your calorie intake, and you are more likely to regularly consume the correct amount of calories per day.\r\n\r\nYou should keep in mind however that all calories are not created equally. It is important that you get not only the right amount of fuel for your body but also that it comes from appropriate sources (for example unsaturated fats are better for you than saturated). Regular exercise, plenty of sleep and a balanced diet will help curb any cravings.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in decreasing your appetite, moderate intensity aerobic exercise (\u003C75% intensity for 30-90 minutes) has demonstrated as much as a 60% reduction in appetite immediately after the workout. High intensity exercise (\u003E75% intensity) such as high intensity interval training (HIIT), has been found to be even more effective. The effect is not long lasting and we therefore recommend that you do regular, high intensity training sessions to get a consistent effect.\r\n\r\nA problem many people have when it comes to managing their appetite is picturing how many calories are actually in their meals, especially if they are not cooking at home. Although many people know that fast food is high in calories, it may come as a surprise that a regular burger combo often contains as many as 1,700 kcal, or more than half of the average adult\u0027s daily requirement. A good option, if you struggle with this issue, is to prepare all of your meals for the day ahead of time so that you know that you have your exact calorie intake for the day sorted. Thus, you can avoid ordering something from a menu or throwing together ingredients in a pan, and accidentally blowing your calorie budget. \r\nIncluding lots of low calorie ingredients such as vegetables (for example a cup of carrot sticks only contains 50 kcal) is another easy trick, as with these foods you can eat more, without actually consuming a lot of calories.",

The symptoms for all three are similar, and therefore it is best to consult your doctor to determine the underlying cause of any problems. Do also check out your gene results for IBS, as this may help you understand the source of your problems.\r\n\r\nIf you do decide to cut gluten from your diet, you should be sure to replace gluten-containing foods with healthy alternatives. Many people replace whole grains with foods much higher in fats, which can lead to an overall increased calorie intake, and eventually weight gain. Another thing to remember is that whole grains are an excellent source of fibre, iron, folate, vitamin B12 (because most non gluten-free breakfast cereals are fortified) and zinc. Corn, amaranth and buckwheat are all whole grains that do not contain gluten and should be considered as good options for replacements if you do decide to cut gluten from your diet.",

            "body":"You are genetically likely to have a higher proportion of fast twitch muscle fibres.\r\n\r\nMost people with a predominance of these muscles will have a bigger overall physique, with visibly larger skeletal muscles. This is because fast-twitch muscle fibres grow in both strength and size in response to physical exercise, whereas slow-twitch muscles do not.\r\n\r\nThis muscle profile suggests that you would be more suited for power than endurance based training.\r\n\r\nFast twitch muscle fibres contract with high force but they are only able to sustain this effect for a few seconds before the muscle begins to tire. Athletes with a predominance of these muscle fibres are therefore very well suited to exercises such as lifting weights in short, explosive bursts.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that you cannot practice endurance training. Fast-twitch muscle fibres are more adaptable than their slow twitch counterparts in that they can convert between two subtypes in response to training. This means that when you practice aerobic, endurance exercises, some of your type 2b \u2018classical power\u2019 fibres can be converted to type 2a \u2018intermediate\u2019 muscle fibres. This conversion increases your capacity for endurance based exercise and gives you an advantage in sports like middle distance running, or rugby, where both explosive power and cardio fitness are important.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to note that there are other important genetic factors that influence how well suited you are to power based training - check out your VO2 max potential, muscle size and growth, and overall endurance vs power profile to find out more.",

            "body":"You are genetically more likely to use your fat as a fuel e.g. for exercise and less likely to store it.\r\n\r\nThis means that you are less susceptible to gaining weight and that your body is effective at burning fat after physical activities. Nevertheless, excessive calorie intake will eventually lead to weight gain through increased fat storage.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to watch out for the kinds of fats you are consuming. You should consider replacing most of your saturated fat intake with unsaturated fats derived from nuts, seeds, fish and plant oils. Unsaturated fats are not only found in more healthy foods, but they also help prevent\/remove visceral fat storage, which can have long term health consequences.\r\n\r\nA healthy diet and regular exercise is still important to help you maintain a healthy weight. A diet containing some fats is necessary for your body to function optimally, and sticking to the mid to upper-range (30-40%) of the daily requirement is recommended for you. It is often suggested that high intensity interval training, in combination with long-distance cardiovascular exercise (such as running for more than 20 minutes) is the best combination of exercise when it comes to burning calories and fat stores.\r\n\r\nIf gaining weight is your goal, then the type of fat you are eating becomes even more important. In order to gain weight you need to either build muscle, or force your body to store excess calories as fat. Favouring foods containing unsaturated fats will decrease the chance that your body will store calories as visceral fat. However, this is only true up to a point, and despite your low sensitivity the recommended intake of 40% of your calories from fat should still be followed.",

If you have already developed intolerance, you might already be familiar with the side effects of consuming lactose from a young age. They can range from abdominal pain and bloating to nausea and diarrhea beginning anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours after consumption. \r\n\r\nSometimes, lactose intolerant people can still consume cheese and butter, because the fermentation process breaks down most of the lactose present in the milk. As a general rule, foods with a lactose content of less than 2 % are considered safe, but figuring out how much your body can handle usually requires some trial and error. \r\n\r\nAll dairy products are not created equally, and even within a food group the lactose content depends on the exact recipe followed.

You are less sensitive to alcohol and the effects of alcohol will hit you at a slower pace. It will take a larger amount of alcohol intake before you lose your inhibitions and senses, and you are therefore more likely to drink more than others. This does not necessarily have an impact on your degree of hangover.\r\n\r\nYou should take care of your alcohol intake though, as you are also more prone to long term negative effects such as alcohol dependence, increased blood pressure and high cholesterol numbers if you drink excessively.\r\n\r\nIf you want to lose weight it is probably a good idea to stay away from alcoholic drinks. Your body will burn the energy from alcohol before any other energy sources because of alcohol\u2019s toxicity to your body, and because the body cannot store alcohol. Therefore you are more likely to store fats in your body while you have alcohol in your system. If you do not want to give up on alcohol completely the best drinks will be the ones based on sparkling water so the amount of calories consumed will be diminished.\r\n\r\nAlcohol affects a number of hormones that can influence your workout ability. Your testosterone levels will fall and your stress hormone (cortisol) will increase. The combination of these can lead to breakdown of muscle mass in the longer term. In the short term, it will hinder the formation of new muscle. Therefore, if you are serious about training you should drink in moderation or avoid alcohol consumption completely. You should also keep an eye on your blood sugar and water intake if you workout during or after alcohol intake as alcohol changes the level of these due to its dehydrating effect.",
